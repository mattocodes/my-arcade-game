# Classic Arcade Game

The goal of the Arcade Game is to get your player across the gameboard without colliding into an enemy bug. Once a player reaches the top-river section of the gameboard, the game is won. If a player collides with an enemy bug, the player starts again from the bottom-grassy section of the gameboard.

This game is coded using concept of object-oriented JavaScript.
